# Samuel Ryberg

Greetings! I'm Samuel Ryberg, a dedicated game developer with a strong emphasis on programming. Originally from of Helsingborg, Sweden, but currently living in MalmÃ¶, Sweden. For the past decade, I've been absolutely passionate about the world of creation and video games, and now I've turned that passion into my full-time job.

ðŸŽ“ My Path: I kickstarted my journey into the gaming world during my three years at LBS in Helsingborg, where I first dove into game development using Unity and C#. After that, I took my passion to the next level by enrolling at TGA (The Game Assembly), a school specialized in game development. There, I spent two intense years and an 8-month internship on Flashbulb Games in Copenhagen, Denmark.

ðŸ’¡ Continuous Learning: The tech world is constantly evolving, and I thrive on staying at the forefront of emerging technologies. My commitment to growth means that I'm always on the lookout for new ways to enhance my craft. Whether it's mastering the latest programming languages or exploring innovative game development techniques, I believe that there's always room for improvement.

ðŸŒŸ Why I'm Here: I'm passionate about connecting with like-minded professionals, collaborating on exciting projects, and sharing insights within the gaming and programming communities. Let's connect and explore how our shared interests can lead to incredible opportunities in this dynamic industry.

ðŸ“¬ Get in Touch: Feel free to reach out if you share my enthusiasm for game development, programming, or tech innovation. I'm always open to discussions, collaboration, and networking.
